Multitabber
===========


To work in an organised manner without a saturation of windows, you can create virtual desktops for working on different levels or also to have more personalised tabs in other environments. To perform these types of desktop constructions you need tools to configure them, one of these is MultiTabber, an application which manages the creation of up to ten virtual desktops that work at the same time. The programme proposes a new view of desktop management where it shows which of the desktops the User is currently working on and its position. With this type of tool it will be very easy to be able to perform well distinguished tasks on the level of classification. 

MultiTabber, offers a different way to view your virtual desktops near to the system tray. The way in which a desktop views the other desktops created is by small icons which have circles with the numbers ordered according to creation. Desktop management can be controlled by the mouse. The image in the control panel of the desktops can be customized to the User's taste. Furthermore, Users will be able to add different features at operational level.
